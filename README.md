### Beyond simply testing the website, the goal of this project was to demonstrate how testing processes can be streamlined by leveraging efficient tools and methodologies.

## Project Highlights
A key focus was to simplify and optimize the login test case by replacing the use of a properties file for test data with Apache POI for reading data dynamically from Excel files.
This approach not only reduced the complexity of the code but also made the test cases more scalable, reusable, and easier to maintain.
The project serves as an example of how automated testing can be both powerful and straightforward when best practices and efficient tools are utilized.

The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure modularity and reusability. This approach separates test logic from page actions, making the framework easier to maintain and extend.

Dynamic Test Data Management: Login data is now retrieved from an Excel
Scalability: The framework supports easy addit
Detailed Reporting: Integrated with Extent Reports for generating professional-grade test execution reports.
